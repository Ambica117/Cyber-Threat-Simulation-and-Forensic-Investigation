# Cyber Threat Simulation and Forensic Investigation
• Vulnerability Scanning: Identified open ports (e.g., 22, 80) and running services (e.g., 
SSH, HTTP). 
• Traffic Capture: Detected unusual traffic patterns, indicating possible data exfiltration 
attempts. 
• Packet Analysis: Revealed unencrypted credentials being transmitted over HTTP. 
• Brute Force Attack: Successfully cracked weak SSH passwords, demonstrating the 
need for stronger password policies.
