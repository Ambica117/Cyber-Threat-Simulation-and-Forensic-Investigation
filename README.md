# Cyber Threat Simulation and Forensic Investigation
1. Simulate cyber threats (e.g., brute force attacks, network sniffing, vulnerability 
scanning). 
2. Conduct penetration testing on IoT devices to identify weaknesses. 
3. Perform digital forensics to analyze attack patterns and compromised traffic. 
4. Generate security reports with mitigation strategies.
